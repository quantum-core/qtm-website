		meditation?</span><br>
		<br>
		Quantum is a method of meditation that reaches our deepest central 
		awareness under conditions of stillness and simplicity. We believe that 
		the core of our life energy is expressed along the spine at the subtle 
		quantum interface of matter and energy. Quantum meditation brings the 
		intellect and feelings together to commune with that quantum interface. 
		Performing Quantum meditation will give you fast, harmonious mind-body 
		awareness and relaxation to enable you to live a more fulfilling life.<br>
		<br>
		During meditation, a person trains their mind and induces a mode of 
		consciousness to arrive at harmony and dynamic health. Meditation is a 
		very old discipline and has been practiced by people historically as a 
		powerful tool for personal improvement and spiritual enlightenment.<br>
		<br>
		Human beings seek pleasure and, hence, pursue sensory objects for 
		self-gratification. What we often do not realize is that pleasure, and 
		pain, are subjective experiences. The Quantum meditation technique works 
		on this and helps people to find their own inner source of bliss through 
		controlled breathing, stretching and focusing on positive sensations 
		along the quantum interface in the spine. People who practice Quantum 
		meditation find it works very quickly to produce feelings of happiness 
		and relaxation they have never felt before.<br>

		<b><span style="font-size: 14pt">How much does it cost to take part in 
		Quantum Meditation?</span></b><br>
		<br>
		Nothing! It’s free. We don’t believe in charging people for 
		enlightenment and are a registered charity. We ask that people make 
		donations if they can, and we put that money to helping others in 
		difficult situations.<br>
		<br>
		The Quantum Foundation in Bangladesh was established to help others and 
		built a blood centre in Bangladesh, which saves lives. The Foundation 
		also helps the deprived local community by bringing education, health 
		and other services including safe drinking water and circumcisions. With 
		our willingness to serve and help others, we are succeeding in changing 
		people’s lives.<br>

		<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">Location</span><br>
		Quantum London is based at 66 Hanbury Street, London E1 5JL, England. As 
		well as working out of this address, we also hold online meditation 
		events with thousands of participants, and provide help and information 
		on Quantum meditation online – wherever you are in the world you can 
		access our information.</span></font></p>
